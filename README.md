## Constructor Hangman

### Overview

Hangman command-line (CLI) game using constructor functions.

## Instructions

The completed game should meet the following criteria:

1. Receives user input using the`inquirer npm` package.

2. Constructor functions:

  * **Word**: An object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess.

  * **Letter**: Each letter object either display an underlying character, or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. 

3. The user's remaining guesses are tracked and the user is prompted if they would like to end the game when no guesses remain.

4. Each constructor function is in it's own file; exported and required where needed.
